# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

One of the most important component of autonomous vehicles is to recognize traffic signs it encounters. In this Python project a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed which classifies traffic signs into one on 43 different signs. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs.
### Dataset
The dataset for this project used is given below\
\
[Traffic Signs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)\
\
The dataset contains over 50,000 images of 43 different traffic signs. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model
